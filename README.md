# ETF Portfolio Optimization

Given the uncertainty about the future performance of ﬁnancial markets, investors typically diversify their portfolios to improve the quality of their returns. In this project, I constructed a portfolio composed of two ETFs (exchange traded funds) that tracks US equity and ﬁxed income markets. The equity ETF tracks the widely followed S&P 500 while the ﬁxed income ETF tracks long-term US Treasury bonds. I used optimization techniques to determine what fraction of money should be allotted to each asset (i.e., portfolio weights).

The data for the two assets were downloaded from Google Finance (ticker symbols: SPY, TLT) and the federal funds interest rate, representing the risk free rate, was taken from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank website.
